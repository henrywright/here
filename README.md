# Here

Here makes use of the WordPress Transients API to keep a record of who's currently online. A dot is used to indicate a user is "here". If a user has been inactive for _n_ minutes, the dot is removed.

## Requirements

 - WordPress 3.8 or higher
 - BuddyPress 2.2 or higher

The plugin may work with earlier versions but I haven't tested.

## Installation

To get the stable version, go to the WordPress [Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/). Alternatively you can install with Composer thanks to [WPackagist](http://wpackagist.org/).
